# Bonfire.Files

File management extension for Bonfire.  

This extension wraps the `Entrepot`[1] file management library, 
adding support for media type checking, image resizing, and the like, 
along a [pointable][2] schema for storage of file data.

# S3 Object Storage Setup in Bonfire

Bonfire supports storing uploaded files (such as images, documents, and videos) using S3-compatible object storage services. This is useful for scaling, reliability, and offloading storage from your main server.

This guide will help you configure S3 storage for your Bonfire instance.

## Before You Begin

1. **Choose an S3-Compatible Provider**: You can use AWS S3, MinIO, Hetzner, Scaleway, OVH, DigitalOcean Spaces, Wasabi, or any other cloud storage provider that supports the S3 API.

2. **Create a Bucket**: Set up a bucket/container in your chosen provider's dashboard.

> You can **keep your bucket private** and users will still be able access uploaded files, because Bonfire uses signed URLs for serving files stored in S3-compatible storage. Signed URLs allow temporary, secure access to private objects in your bucket. Only users with a valid signed URL (generated by Bonfire) can access the file, and only for a limited time (default: 2 hours, configurable via `:expires_in`). 

3. **Generate Access Keys**: Obtain an Access Key ID and Secret Access Key with permissions to read/write to your bucket.


4. **(Optional) Set Up a CDN or Custom Domain**: You may want to configure a CDN or a custom domain for your bucket.


## Required Environment Variables

Set the following environment variables in your deployment environment or `.env` file:

- `UPLOADS_S3_BUCKET` — The name of your S3 bucket.
- `UPLOADS_S3_HOST` — The S3 endpoint host (default: `s3.${UPLOADS_S3_REGION}.scw.cloud` for Scaleway).
- `UPLOADS_S3_ACCESS_KEY_ID` — Your S3 access key ID.
- `UPLOADS_S3_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY` — Your S3 secret access key.

Optional variables for advanced configuration:

- `UPLOADS_S3_REGION` — The region of your bucket (default: `fr-par` for Scaleway Paris region).
- `UPLOADS_S3_SCHEME` — The URL scheme, usually `https://`.
- `UPLOADS_S3_PORT` — The port to use (default: `443`).
- `UPLOADS_S3_URL` — Custom asset host or CDN domain (can be set to your CDN or custom bucket domain to customise generated user-facing URLs).
- `USE_S3` — Set to `yes` if you need to force S3 usage in development/test environments (by default it's only used in prod).

Example `.env` snippet for Scaleway:
```
UPLOADS_S3_BUCKET=my-bonfire-bucket
UPLOADS_S3_ACCESS_KEY_ID=...
UPLOADS_S3_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=...
UPLOADS_S3_REGION=fr-par
UPLOADS_S3_HOST=s3.fr-par.scw.cloud
```

Example for AWS S3:
```
UPLOADS_S3_BUCKET=my-bonfire-bucket
UPLOADS_S3_ACCESS_KEY_ID=...
UPLOADS_S3_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=...
UPLOADS_S3_REGION=eu-west-1
UPLOADS_S3_HOST=s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com
```

## How It Works

- When the above variables are set, Bonfire will use S3 storage for file uploads.
- The configuration is handled in `Bonfire.Files.RuntimeConfig`.
- The S3 handling logic is implemented in `Entrepot.Storages.S3`, `ExAws.S3`, and `ExAws`.

## Notes

- If you do not set the S3 variables, Bonfire will default to local storage.
- For public file access, ensure your bucket policy allows public reads or use a CDN.
- For private buckets, signed URLs are generated for access.
- You can use any S3-compatible service by adjusting the `UPLOADS_S3_HOST` and `UPLOADS_S3_REGION`.


## Troubleshooting

- **Uploads not working?** Double-check your credentials and bucket permissions.
- **Files not accessible?** Ensure your bucket policy or CDN is configured for public access, or use signed URLs.
- **Wrong URLs?** Set `UPLOADS_S3_URL` to your CDN or bucket domain.
